            <h2>⚖️ Ethics in Cyber Security</h2>

            <h3>Digital Privacy - The Foundation of Trust</h3>
            <div class="concept">
                <h4>Understanding Digital Privacy in Our Connected World</h4>
                <p><strong>Digital privacy</strong> is like having curtains on your windows - you decide what the outside world can see about your personal life. In the digital realm, this means controlling what information is collected about you, how it's used, and who can access it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Every day, you generate thousands of digital footprints - every click, search, purchase, and message creates data about you. This information, when combined, creates a detailed profile that can be more intimate than what your closest friends know about you.</p>
                
                <div class="example-detailed">
                    <h4>Real-World Example: The Cambridge Analytica Scandal</h4>
                    <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users without consent.</p>
                    
                    <h5>The Privacy Violation Process:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Initial Data Collection:</strong> A quiz app collected data from 270,000 users who consented</li>
                        <li><strong>Friend Network Exploitation:</strong> The app also collected data from these users' friends (50+ million people) WITHOUT their consent</li>
                        <li><strong>Profile Building:</strong> This data was used to build psychological profiles of voters</li>
                        <li><strong>Political Manipulation:</strong> These profiles were used to target political advertisements during elections</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> People's private information was used to influence their political beliefs and voting behavior, fundamentally undermining democratic processes.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> This case showed how privacy violations can have far-reaching consequences beyond individual harm - they can affect entire societies.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h4>The Six Pillars of Privacy Protection</h4>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h5>1. Data Minimization - "Collect Only What You Need"</h5>
                    <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Organizations should only collect personal information that is necessary for their stated purpose.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> When you sign up for a weather app, it should only ask for your location (to provide weather data), not your contacts, photos, or browsing history.</p>
                    
                    <h6>How to Identify Violations:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apps asking for permissions unrelated to their function</li>
                        <li>Websites requiring excessive personal information for basic services</li>
                        <li>Companies collecting data "just in case" they might need it later</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h5>2. Purpose Limitation - "Use Data Only for What You Said"</h5>
                    <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Data collected for one purpose shouldn't be used for another without explicit consent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> If you provide your email to receive order confirmations, the company shouldn't use it to send marketing emails unless you specifically agreed to that.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Common Violations:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using customer data for advertising when it was collected for service delivery</li>
                        <li>Selling customer information to third parties without consent</li>
                        <li>Repurposing data when business models change</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h5>3. Transparency - "Tell People What You're Doing"</h5>
                    <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Organizations must clearly explain their data practices in understandable language.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example-detailed">
                        <h6>Good vs. Bad Privacy Policies</h6>
                        
                        <h6>❌ Bad Example (Vague and Confusing):</h6>
                        <p>"We may collect various types of information to improve user experience and for legitimate business purposes. This information may be shared with partners for operational efficiency."</p>
                        
                        <h6>✅ Good Example (Clear and Specific):</h6>
                        <p>"We collect your name and email when you create an account. We use your name to personalize your experience and your email to send order confirmations. We never share this information with advertisers or sell it to other companies."</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h5>4. User Control - "Let People Manage Their Data"</h5>
                    <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Individuals should have control over their personal information.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Essential User Rights:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Right to see what data is collected</li>
                        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Right to fix incorrect information</li>
                        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Right to have data deleted ("Right to be Forgotten")</li>
                        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Right to take your data to another service</li>
                        <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> Right to stop data collection</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example-detailed">
                        <h6>Case Study: Google's Data Controls</h6>
                        <p>Google provides users with comprehensive data controls through "My Activity" and "Data & Personalization" settings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users can see every search query, YouTube video watched, and location visited</li>
                            <li>They can delete individual items or entire categories of data</li>
                            <li>They can turn off data collection for specific services</li>
                            <li>They can download all their data in a portable format</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Why This Works:</strong> It gives users genuine control while being transparent about data practices.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h5>5. Security - "Protect What You Collect"</h5>
                    <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Personal data must be protected with appropriate technical and organizational measures.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Security Measures for Personal Data:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data scrambled so unauthorized people can't read it</li>
                        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Only authorized personnel can access data</li>
                        <li><strong>Audit Logs:</strong> Track who accessed what data when</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Security Updates:</strong> Keep systems patched and secure</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Backups:</strong> Protect against data loss</li>

                    <h5>6. Accountability - "Take Responsibility"</h5>
                    <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Organizations must be able to demonstrate compliance with privacy principles.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Accountability Measures:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regular privacy impact assessments</li>
                        <li>Staff training on privacy practices</li>
                        <li>Incident response procedures for data breaches</li>

                    <h4>The Privacy Paradox - Why People Share Despite Risks</h4>
                    <p><strong>The Contradiction:</strong> Surveys show people value privacy highly, yet they continue sharing personal information online.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Why This Happens:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Immediate Benefits:</strong> Convenience and social connection outweigh abstract privacy risks</li>
                        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Privacy policies are too complex to understand</li>
                        <li><strong>Invisibility:</strong> Data collection happens in the background</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Pressure:</strong> Fear of missing out if not participating</li>
                        <li><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong> Feeling that privacy is already lost</li>

                <h4>Understanding Intellectual Property in the Digital Age</h4>
                <p><strong>Intellectual Property (IP)</strong> is like a legal fence around creative and innovative work. Just as you wouldn't want someone to steal your physical possessions, creators need protection for their ideas, inventions, and creative expressions in the digital world.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Digital Challenge:</strong> The internet makes it incredibly easy to copy, distribute, and modify digital content. A single click can duplicate a file millions of times, making IP protection both more important and more difficult than ever before.</p>

            <h3>Steganography</h3>
            <div class="concept">
                <h4>What is Steganography?</h4>
                <p><strong>Steganography</strong> is the practice of hiding information within other non-secret text or data. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable, steganography hides the existence of data entirely.</p>
                
                <h4>Steganography Techniques:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Image Steganography:</strong> Hiding data in image files (LSB method)</li>
                    <li><strong>Audio Steganography:</strong> Concealing information in sound files</li>
                    <li><strong>Video Steganography:</strong> Embedding data in video streams</li>
                    <li><strong>Text Steganography:</strong> Hiding messages in text formatting</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Steganography:</strong> Covert channels in network protocols</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="example-detailed">
                    <h4>Example: LSB Image Steganography</h4>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Hide text message "HELP" in an image using Least Significant Bit method.</p>

                        <li>Convert text to binary: "HELP" → 01001000 01000101 01001100 01010000</li>
                        <li>Take image pixels (RGB values)</li>
                        <li>Replace least significant bits of pixel values with message bits</li>
                        <li>Modified image looks identical to human eye</li>
                        <li>Secret message can be extracted by reading LSBs</li>
