            <div class="concept">
                <h3>What is Cyber Security?</h3>
                <p><strong>Cyber Security</strong> is like having multiple locks, alarms, and guards protecting your digital house. Just as you wouldn't leave your front door open in a neighborhood with burglars, we can't leave our digital systems unprotected in a world full of cyber criminals.</p>
                
                <p>More formally, cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
                
                <div class="example-detailed">
                    <h4>Real-World Example: Online Banking Security</h4>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> When you log into your bank account online, multiple security layers protect your money:</p>
                    
                    <h5>Security Layers in Action:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> Your communication with the bank is scrambled so eavesdroppers can't read it</li>
                        <li><strong>Username/Password:</strong> First verification of your identity</li>
                        <li><strong>OTP (One-Time Password):</strong> Second verification via SMS or app</li>
                        <li><strong>Session Timeout:</strong> Automatic logout after inactivity</li>
                        <li><strong>Transaction Limits:</strong> Maximum amounts to limit damage if compromised</li>
                        <li><strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> Unusual activity triggers alerts</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Without these protections, attackers could intercept your login, steal your credentials, and empty your account within minutes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>The CIA Triad - Foundation of Security</h3>
                <p>All cybersecurity is built on three fundamental principles, known as the CIA Triad:</p>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h4>1. Confidentiality (The "C")</h4>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals.</p>
                    <p><strong>Think of it like:</strong> Having a private diary with a lock - only you should be able to read it.</p>
                    
                    <h5>How Confidentiality is Broken:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Hackers steal customer databases from companies</li>
                        <li><strong>Eavesdropping:</strong> Someone intercepts your phone calls or emails</li>
                        <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Someone logs into your account without permission</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>How We Protect Confidentiality:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Scrambling data so only authorized people can read it</li>
                        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Password protection, user permissions</li>
                        <li><strong>Need-to-Know Basis:</strong> Only sharing information with people who need it</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example-detailed">
                        <h5>Example: WhatsApp End-to-End Encryption</h5>
                        <p>When you send a WhatsApp message, it's encrypted on your phone before sending. Even if someone intercepts the message during transmission, they see gibberish like "X7$9mK@pL3" instead of "Meet me at 5 PM". Only the recipient's phone can decrypt and read the actual message.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h4>2. Integrity (The "I")</h4>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data.</p>
                    <p><strong>Think of it like:</strong> Ensuring that when you send a message saying "Transfer $100", it doesn't get changed to "Transfer $10,000" along the way.</p>
                    
                    <h5>How Integrity is Compromised:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Tampering:</strong> Attackers modify files or databases</li>
                        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> Changing data during transmission</li>
                        <li><strong>Unauthorized Modifications:</strong> Someone changes important documents</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>How We Protect Integrity:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Cryptographic proof that data hasn't been changed</li>
                        <li><strong>Checksums:</strong> Mathematical fingerprints of files</li>
                        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Tracking all changes to documents</li>
                        <li><strong>Access Logs:</strong> Recording who accessed what and when</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example-detailed">
                        <h5>Example: Software Updates</h5>
                        <p>When you download an app update, your phone checks a digital signature to ensure the update really came from the app developer and hasn't been modified by hackers. If the signature doesn't match, your phone rejects the update to protect you from malicious software.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h4>3. Availability (The "A")</h4>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Think of it like:</strong> Making sure the ATM works when you need cash, or that Google is accessible when you need to search for something.</p>
                    
                    <h5>How Availability is Attacked:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>DDoS Attacks:</strong> Overwhelming servers with fake traffic</li>
                        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypting files and demanding payment</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical Attacks:</strong> Destroying servers or cutting cables</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource Exhaustion:</strong> Consuming all system memory or processing power</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>How We Protect Availability:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Having backup systems ready</li>
                        <li><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> Distributing traffic across multiple servers</li>
                        <li><strong>DDoS Protection:</strong> Filtering out malicious traffic</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Backups:</strong> Keeping copies of important data</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example-detailed">
                        <h5>Example: Netflix Streaming</h5>
                        <p>Netflix uses thousands of servers worldwide. If one server fails, your movie automatically switches to another server without interruption. They also keep multiple copies of each movie, so even if several servers fail, you can still watch your show. This is availability protection in action.</p>

            <h3>Firewalls - Your Digital Security Guards</h3>
            <div class="concept">
                <h4>What is a Firewall?</h4>
                <p>Imagine your computer network as a gated community. A <strong>firewall</strong> is like the security guard at the gate who checks everyone coming in and going out. The guard has a list of rules about who to allow and who to block.</p>
                
                <p>Technically, a firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It establishes a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks like the Internet.</p>
                
                <div class="visual-diagram">
                    <h4>How a Firewall Works</h4>
                    <div class="diagram-text">
                        <pre>
Internet (Untrusted)     Firewall (Security Guard)     Internal Network (Trusted)
                                    │
Hacker → Malicious Traffic → [BLOCKED] ✖ Firewall Rules
User   → Legitimate Web    → [ALLOWED] ✓ Port 80/443 → Company Website
Email  → Business Email   → [ALLOWED] ✓ Port 25/465  → Email Server
                                    │
                            Rules Database:
                            • Allow HTTP (Port 80)
                            • Allow HTTPS (Port 443)
                            • Allow Email (Port 25, 465)
                            • Block everything else

                <h4>Detailed Firewall Types and How They Work:</h4>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h5>1. Packet-Filtering Firewalls (First Generation)</h5>
                    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Like a simple security guard who only checks ID cards. It looks at each packet of data and makes decisions based on basic information like source IP address, destination IP address, and port numbers.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example-detailed">
                        <h6>Example: Home Router Firewall</h6>
                        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Your home WiFi router has a built-in packet-filtering firewall.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Rule Example:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Rule 1:</strong> Allow traffic from internal network (192.168.1.0/24) to anywhere</li>
                            <li><strong>Rule 2:</strong> Allow incoming traffic only if it's a response to outgoing traffic</li>
                            <li><strong>Rule 3:</strong> Block all other incoming traffic</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h6>In Practice:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✅ You can browse websites (outgoing request, incoming response allowed)</li>
                            <li>✅ You can check email (outgoing connection, incoming data allowed)</li>
                            <li>❌ Hackers can't directly connect to your computer (no outgoing request = blocked)</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h6>Limitations:</h6>
                        <p>This firewall can't tell if a website response contains a virus, or if an email attachment is malicious. It only knows "this traffic matches my rules" or "this doesn't match."</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h5>Advantages:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Very fast because it only looks at basic packet information</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to configure and understand</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Cost:</strong> Minimal hardware requirements</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Doesn't interfere with applications</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Application Awareness:</strong> Can't understand what applications are doing</li>
                        <li><strong>Stateless:</strong> Doesn't remember previous connections</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Protection:</strong> Can't detect sophisticated attacks</li>
                        <li><strong>Rule Complexity:</strong> Large rule sets become hard to manage</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-concepts">
                    <h5>2. Stateful Inspection Firewalls (Second Generation)</h5>
                    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Like a smarter security guard who remembers everyone who entered and keeps track of ongoing conversations. It maintains a table of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example-detailed">
                        <h6>Example: Corporate Network Protection</h6>

                        <h6>Stateful Inspection Process:</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Outgoing Request:</strong> Employee's computer sends HTTP request to website</li>
                            <li><strong>State Table Entry:</strong> Firewall creates entry: "Employee IP → Website IP, Port 80, Status: Connecting"</li>
                            <li><strong>Incoming Response:</strong> Website sends back web page data</li>

- Firewall can completely analyze all data
- External servers never directly touch internal network
- Firewall can modify, block, or log everything

                <p><strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong> is like the phone book of the internet. When you type "google.com" in your browser, DNS translates that human-readable name to the actual IP address (like 172.217.12.14) where Google's servers are located.</p>

                <h4>Why Social Engineering is So Effective</h4>
                <p><strong>Social Engineering</strong> is like being a con artist, but for cybersecurity. Instead of breaking through technical defenses (which is hard), attackers manipulate people (which is often easier) to give them what they want.</p>
                
                <p>The key insight: <strong>Humans are often the weakest link in security.</strong> You can have the most sophisticated firewalls and encryption, but if someone tricks your employee into giving them the password, all that technology becomes useless.</p>

                    <p>An attacker might successfully get through the first layer using a sophisticated attack, but then faces four more layers of defense. Breaking through all five layers simultaneously is extremely difficult and time-consuming, giving security teams time to detect and respond.</p>
